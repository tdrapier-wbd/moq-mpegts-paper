"""Grade an MPEG-TS stream's PCR against its own asserted clock.

    moq ... export ts | ts-pcr-timing.py --live --seconds 45
    ts-pcr-timing.py capture.ts

A PCR is three claims at once, and a fix in one of them is invisible to an
instrument pointed at another:

    value       the intervals between PCR values         (ISO 13818-1 / TR 101 290)
    release     when the bytes carrying them were handed over  (--live only)
    position    where the PCR packets sit among the media bytes

Every check is an invariant on the stream, not an assertion about how the stream
was produced. `release` grades arrival against the PCR's *own* values rather than
against a wall clock, so it needs no reference clock, no source file and no
declared mux rate; the price is that a clock running at the wrong rate stays
internally consistent under it and has to be caught by `value` and `position`.

Exit status is 0 when every hard check passes, 1 otherwise. `--strict` promotes
the report-only (shape) checks to hard.
